This repository was originally created to show how people could use GitHub to collaborate on an ``Ackee and Saltfish`` recipe. It now has multiple examples.

.. image:: images/image-01.jpg

Add your own to the list or update existing ones. Here are some guidelines.

#. Location:

    #. All recipes are in the `recipes folder <recipes/>`_. Add and modify recipes there.
    #. Create a new folder for a new recipe. Put all images for your recipe in sub-folder called ``images``.
#. Images:

    #. As stated before, put images in a sub-folder of your recipe. The sub-folder should be called ``images``.
    #. Whenever possible, use photos that are 600px wide. This makes the pages more consistent.

#. Attribution:

    #. Always attribute the source of your images or recipes with URL links or text.

#. Ordering:

    #. Keep the list below in alphabetical order.

Give them a try!
